after we ran - npm install 
npx create-next-app@latest ./ 

remeber we installed , tailwind , alias and app router 
and this is the folder structure 

app 
node_modules 
public 
.gitignore 
jsconfig.json 
next.config.js
package-lock.json 
package.json 
postcss.config.json 
tailwind.config.js


then we will run 
npx install bcrypt mongodb next-auth 

which we are gonna use to hash passwords 
mongodb for our database and mongoose 
and finally we gonna have next-auth 

remember we are addin  bcrypt mongodb next-auth 


now we delete the app directory 


goto root(1.NEXTJS)  and we will create that by myself and name it app also we will create models , and components directory.
models is gonna be for databases like mongodb , mongoose.

then also delete the public  and create styles , utils and finally a last file which is gonna be .env(inside which we will simply store secure keys ).

and this is what the updated file is gonna look like - 

app 
components 
node_modules 
public 
styles 
.env
.gitignore
jsconfig.json 
next.config.js
package-lock.json 
package.json 
postcss.config.js
readme.md 
tailwind.config.js 

now go to jist of the github and make the files and paste the code . 
the globals.css goes within the styles 
then wewe downloaded the zip folder of assests and created 
a page.jsx in the app (which is going to render our home page ).

then we go and create the layout.jsx inside the app .
